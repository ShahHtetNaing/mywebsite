I’m a cybersecurity professional with a strong passion for web development and cloud solutions. Alongside safeguarding digital spaces, I enjoy creating websites and have hosted my personal site using AWS S3 for a secure and efficient static website experience. I’m committed to exploring new technologies that merge security with innovative web solutions.
